        <h1>Section 3: Rules of the Game</h1>
        <p>Understanding the rules of tennis is essential for playing the game. The game is played on a rectangular court with a net dividing the two sides. Points are scored by hitting the ball over the net and into the opponent's court in such a way that the opponent cannot return it.</p>
